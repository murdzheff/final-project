Tinder Clone Single Page Application

This documentation is for a Tinder clone single page application built using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. This project was developed as a final project for graduating from ItTalents academy by Georgi Murdzheff and Anzhelo Stoyanov.

Features:

The Tinder clone single page application is designed to work similarly to the popular dating app, Tinder. Users can create an account, swipe through other users' profiles, and match with other users based on mutual interest.

Technologies Used:

The application uses React for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MongoDB as the database. The following npm libraries were used:

    react-tinder-card: A library that provides swipeable cards for the UI
    bcrypt: A library used for hashing passwords and securing user accounts

User Accounts:

Users can create an account using their email address or through their Facebook account. After creating an account, users can add information to their profile such as their name, age, location, and profile picture. Users can also write a short bio describing themselves.

Matching:

Users can swipe right on profiles they're interested in or swipe left on profiles they're not interested in. If two users swipe right on each other's profiles, they'll be matched and can start messaging each other.
Messaging:

Users can message their matches using a real-time chat feature.

Security:

The application uses bcrypt to hash passwords and secure user accounts. This ensures that user data is kept safe and protected from potential hackers.

Conclusion:

The Tinder clone single page application is a fun and engaging way for users to meet new people. With its swipeable cards and real-time chat feature, it provides a user-friendly experience similar to the original Tinder app. Developed by the talented team at ItTalents academy, Georgi Murdzheff and Anzhelo Stoyanov, this project showcases their proficiency in React, Node.js, and MongoDB, as well as their commitment to ensuring the security of user data.
